The data described in "BRFSS Blog.pdf" comes from the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System(BRFSS) Questionnaire. An excerpt from the CDC’s about page for BRFSS describes it as
“the nation’s premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about
U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use
of preventive services.” The 2022 BRFSS Questionnaire has 445,132 records dating from early
2022 to mid 2023, and has over 200 different questions for participants to answer. The BRFSS is
sponsored by the CDC, and a variety of other government agencies. For this analysis, the BRFSS
data is subsetted to only responses recorded by participants residing in New Jersey, leaving only
8,209 records. This analysis will primarily focus on the responses to the question “In general,
how satisfied are you with your life?” in relation to responses about questions asking about
participants’ physical health and mental health.
